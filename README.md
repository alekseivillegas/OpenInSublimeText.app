There are two ways to do it and both are quite simple and stupid:

1. Just <a href="https://github.com/downloads/yeco/OpenInSublimeText.app/OpenInSublimeText.zip">download it</a> unzip it to your apps folder and drag and drop it in your finder's toolbar.

2. Clone it as *OpenInSublimeText.app* in your apps folder and and drag and drop it in your finder's toolbar.
